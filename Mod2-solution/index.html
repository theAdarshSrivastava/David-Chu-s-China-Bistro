      <h2>Supervised</h2>
      <p>
        In supervised learning, the machine uses labeled training data. It is told the correct output and it compares its own output which informs the subsequent steps, adjusting itself along the way.

      <h2>Unsupervised</h2>
      <p>
        In unsupervised learning, the data isn't labeled. The machine must figure out the correct answer without being told and must therefore discover unknown patterns in the data.

      <h2>Reinforcement</h2>
        <p>
          Reinforcement Learning allows the machine the most freedom. It uses trial and error to discover the actions that yield the greatest rewards. AlphaGo is a famous example of RL.
